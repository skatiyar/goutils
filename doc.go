Package goutils is an utility package which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with go routines.
It takes inspiration from https://caolan.github.io/async and implements utility functions in an idomatic Go way.

goutils provides around 60 functions that include the usual 'functional' suspects (map, reduce, filter, each…) as well as some common patterns for asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…).
